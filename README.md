## Architecture

### Database Schema

### API Design

The service exposes the following API endpoints:

- **Authentication**
  - `POST /auth/signup`: Register a new user
  - `POST /auth/login`: Login a user

- **Payments**
  - `POST /payments`: Create a new payment
  - `GET /payments/{payment_id}`: Retrieve payment status
  - `POST /payments/{payment_id}/refund`: Handle a refund

- **Wallet**
  - `GET /wallet`: Get wallet balance
  - `POST /wallet/credit`: Credit wallet
  - `POST /wallet/debit`: Debit wallet

### Data Flow

1. User signs up and logs in to get an authentication token.
2. User can create a payment or manage their wallet using the provided APIs.
3. Each request is authenticated using JWT tokens.
4. Payment statuses can be retrieved and refunds processed as needed.

### Security Measures

- **Data Encryption**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
- **Authentication**: JWT is used for secure authentication.
- **Authorization**: Middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.
- **Data Validation**: All input data is validated to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
